## Highlights

- **Hierarchical Bayesian Architecture** with attention-weighted multi-scale feature extraction for comprehensive uncertainty quantification  
- **Dual Uncertainty Decomposition** separating epistemic (model uncertainty) and aleatoric (data uncertainty) for interpretable predictions  
- **Multi-Agent System** with specialized agents for disease classification, consistency validation, and adaptive calibration  
- **State-of-the-art Performance** achieving *86.1% AUC* on CheXpert with exceptional calibration *(ECE < 0.02)*  
- **Clinically Interpretable uncertainty estimates** that enable safer deployment in medical decision support systems

## Abstract

This repository contains the implementation of our **Enhanced Bayesian Framework** for uncertainty-aware chest X-ray classification.  

Our approach addresses the critical need for **reliable uncertainty quantification in medical AI** by combining:  

- **Bayesian Classification**  
- **Uncertainty Quantification**  
- **Consistency Validation**  
- **Adaptive Calibration**  

**Key Innovation**: Unlike traditional deep learning models that output point predictions, our framework provides *accurate predictions with uncertainty estimates* that help clinicians understand **when the model is uncertain and why** — crucial for high-stakes medical decisions.

## Architecture Overview

Our framework consists of four main components:

1. **Hierarchical Bayesian Encoder**: Multi-scale feature extraction with variational layers  
2. **Disease Classification Agent**: Bayesian classifier with uncertainty quantification  
3. **Consistency Validation Agent**: Cross-validation of predictions and uncertainties  
4. **Adaptive Calibration Module**: Dynamic temperature and Platt scaling
